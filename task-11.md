# Task 11 — Docker Image and Container Lifecycle

## Purpose

Use this file as the Codex instruction for Task 11. Complete only this task's scope and preserve verified work from earlier tasks.

## Project context and non-negotiable constraints

- Project: **Containerized Mobile Plan Recommendation Platform**
- GitHub owner: `SrishtiYadav1904`
- Tasks 1–3 are already completed. Treat the supplied Task 1–3 document as the source of truth; do not redo those deliverables.
- Stack from the approved document: Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Maven, Thymeleaf, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, MySQL 8 for local/runtime data, H2 for automated tests, JUnit 5, Selenium WebDriver, Tomcat 10.1, Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible.
- UI direction: polished, friendly, modern and responsive; **light theme with soft pink/lilac accents**, clean typography, good spacing, accessible contrast. Do not use a dark theme, cyber/security aesthetic, neon colors, or a generic technical dashboard look.
- Core roles: `CUSTOMER`, `ANALYST`, `ADMINISTRATOR`.
- Plan statuses and valid transitions: `DRAFT → IN_REVIEW` (Analyst submits), `IN_REVIEW → PUBLISHED` (Administrator publishes), `PUBLISHED → ARCHIVED` (Administrator archives). Reject invalid transitions.
- Customers can see only published plans. Analysts can create/update plans and submit them for review. Administrators can approve/publish/archive and manage users.
- MVP functions: registration/login; role-based access; create, view, update, search/filter plans; status workflow; usage-and-budget-based ranked recommendations; dashboard with counts by status/operator and average price; validation and seed data.
- Plan fields: operator, name, price, validity days, daily data GB, voice minutes, SMS count and benefits. Recommendation inputs: monthly data, monthly call minutes, budget and benefit preferences. Use a transparent configurable rule-based score, not machine learning.
- Data model in the approved document: users, plans, recommendation_requests, recommendation_results.
- API operations in the approved document include `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/plans`, `/api/plans/{id}`, `/api/plans/{id}/status`, `/api/recommendations`, `/api/dashboard/summary`, and `/actuator/health`. Keep APIs consistent if the implementation uses server-rendered pages too.
- Port policy: ports **8072, 8081 and 8082 are already in use and must not be used**. Use **8084** for the Tomcat-hosted application and **8085** for the Docker-published application port (host port), with container app port 8080. Jenkins is assumed to be available on its existing port 8080; do not reinstall or change it unless a real environment check proves that is necessary. Check for port conflicts before starting services. Do not bind the app to 8072, 8081 or 8082.
- Repository should be named `containerized-mobile-plan-recommendation-platform` under `SrishtiYadav1904`. Do not assume a repository already exists: inspect the current working directory and Git remote first. If remote creation requires authentication or GitHub UI access, give the user exact manual steps rather than pretending it succeeded.
- Never commit credentials, tokens, passwords, private keys, or local environment files. Use environment variables/Jenkins credentials.
- Work incrementally. Inspect existing files before editing; preserve completed work; do not overwrite unrelated projects or configuration. Run relevant tests after changes and report actual results only. Do not claim a PR, remote push, Jenkins run, Docker Hub push, or deployment happened unless verified.
- Use PowerShell-friendly commands where practical because the developer machine is Windows 11. Explain commands before asking the user to run them if they can affect services or data.
- At the end of each task, create/update the task report in `docs/task-reports/` using the report template below. Record completed work, files changed, commands actually run, test results, evidence locations, issues/blockers and next steps. Distinguish **completed**, **not completed**, and **requires manual action**.

## Codex prompt

Create a production-appropriate Dockerfile for the application, using the approved Java 17/Tomcat 10.1 deployment direction where compatible with the actual WAR build. Use a non-root runtime user where feasible, copy only required artefacts, add a health check if it can be implemented reliably, and avoid embedding credentials. Add `.dockerignore` and document image tagging. Build a local image with a versioned tag and a `latest` tag only if appropriate. Run the container with internal app port 8080 mapped to host port 8085; do not use host ports 8072, 8081 or 8082. Check whether 8085 is free first. Persist database data appropriately if the chosen setup uses a containerized database; never delete unrelated Docker volumes or containers. Demonstrate inspect, logs, stop, start/restart and removal only for this project's own named container. Record exact commands and actual outcomes, image ID, container ID, mapping and health result. If Docker is unavailable, prepare files and commands but mark runtime evidence pending. Update the task report.
